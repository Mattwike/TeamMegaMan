Comments: Looks very good and organized. I like the use of enums. The logic
also looks good and when I tested the megaman collision with blocks it seemed to work fine.

Comments: Quality is decent. Everything seems to work but there is a lot of extra if statements
that could be better placed and condensed.
Change: Make everything more organized as it is all over the place right now. Also
make the if statements easier to read.
