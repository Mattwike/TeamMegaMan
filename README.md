# TeamMegaMan
Controls: Use A and S to move left and right respectively. Use the left mouse to shoot and space to jump. Climbing is not currently active (discussed with the professor) . Use R to reset megaman and Q to quit. Blinking white and blue means that megaman is invulnerable.

Bugs: The pellets currently are not destroyed on impact. Items are missing and the level builder is almost complete (due to internal team issues discussed with the professor). The idle shooting animation is still missing sniper joe does not respawn when pressing R, mega man does not have a health bar or a hud. Damaged state is not implemented on collisions.
