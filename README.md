# TeamMegaMan
Controls: Use A and S to move left and right respectively. Use the left mouse to shoot and space to jump. Climbing is completly active, but it works once (discussed with the professor) . Use R to reset megaman and Q to quit. Press escape to pause and escape to unpause. Blinking white and blue means that megaman is invulnerable.

Bugs: Items are missing and the level builder is almost complete had some weird merge conflicts (due to internal team issues discussed with the professor). The idle shooting animation is still missing sniper joe does not respawn when pressing R, mega man does not have a health bar or a hud. Damaged state runs untill the end of the invunrability.
