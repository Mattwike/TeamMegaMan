Press A and D to move left and right, press left mouse button to shoot, press spacebar to jump. Left and right and top and bottom collisions with blocks work, but when colliding with the bottom of a block there is a brief pause at the top of the arc. You can jump once in mid air. the non moving shooting state is not displaying.
