Comments: Looks very good and organized. I like the use of enums. The logic
also looks good and when I tested the megaman collision with blocks it seemed to work fine.

Comments: Quality is decent. Everything seems to work but there is a lot of extra if statements
that could be better placed and condensed.
Change: Make everything more organized as it is all over the place right now. Also
make the if statements easier to read.

GameObjects/Pellet.cs
Created by Carson Lewis
maintainability: There Will most likely need to be a variable holding the damage that a pellot inflicts for collisions. the Variable name for isfacing left should be ismoving left. Double check if Megaman is needed for the init function.
Time took: 10 minutes
Readability: the code is readable and most are short and have one purpose, just some names are misleading like isfacingleft
